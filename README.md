# Monero-Mining-journey


I started mining Monero on an SFF PC I had around, but I have now switched to a Dell Precision Tower 7810, which has a dual-CPU setup and mines substantially faster 24/7. It utilizes HugePages and all cores on both CPUs, which ends up giving me around 7 kH/s. The CPUs themselves are both Intel Xeons, which I plan to upgrade to the latest generation for better hash rates. I don’t really plan on using the Monero for anything in particular, as it yields less than $100 AUD per year with the current setup.
